Most users interact with dApps via **_browser wallets_**, which usually come in the form of extensions to their browser to enable them to interact easily with the blockchain. Mesh has support for Cardano wallets which accord with [CIP-30 ("Cardano Improvement Proposal 30")](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-0030), and a pre-requisite for this course is that you have at least one installed.

There are a number of different wallets to choose from, including [Eternl](https://eternl.io/), [Lace](https://www.lace.io/), [Nami](https://namiwallet.io/), [Typhon](https://typhonwallet.io/) and [others](https://docs.cardano.org/new-to-cardano/types-of-wallets/). While they all vary in terms of their design, workflow and some details, so long as the implementation faithfully complies with CIP-30, they should offer a common API enabling the dApps to communicate with them.

Where you can obtain the extension depends on your browser: for example, in Brave one can use the menu to go to `preferences > extensions`, similarly for Firefox, and for Chrome you can access them via menu or the Chrome Web Store.

#### Caution!

It is very important that you add only extensions you trust to your browser. It is always worth double-checking that the wallet you are adding is the correct one from the right source. For added security, you can also limit extensions to only interact with a subset of websites.
