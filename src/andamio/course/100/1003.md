# Getting Started With MeshJS - SLT 100.3

SLT: I am familiar with some essentials of the React library, such as components, props, and hooks.

Although there are many new concepts which are useful to learn in Web3 which enable us to take full advantage of this exciting technology, at the heart the goal is to create useful applications for our users.  This means that we can leverage and re-use many of the tools we have already learned from developing in Web2.

In this course, we'll be using the (NextJS) React framework, so expect you to have some familiarity with the essential parts of React which can be used to build modern, powerful applications.

The video gives a short overview of what these elements are with a (very simple) demo.  If you are already a seasoned dev you can definitely skip this, but if you're new this could be a good starting point before checking out the links below.
