# How Does Andamio Work?
Andamio combines a modular learning-management system with a set of smart contracts that support organizations to onboard contributors to projects. To start this course, we will focus on the learning-management features of Andamio. Later, you will learn how to initialize the Andamio Platform on-chain.

To start, let's get oriented to this page.

- **At the top of the page**, you can see the title of this Module: "Write a PBL Course Contract".
- **Below that**, you can see a list of "Student Learning Targets". These describe what you will learn in this Module. Every Module is defined by a list of Student Learning Targets (SLTs).
- **At the top-right**, you can see a list of Lessons and an Assignment for this Module.

Every Module in Andamio starts with a page like this.

## What you will learn in this Course

By the end of this **Andamio PBL Course**, you will be able to build your course just like this one. You will learn by doing: creating your own Andamio instance as you go.

All Courses built in Andamio share these features:
- A **Course** consists of a set of **Modules**.
- Every **Module** consists of a set **Student Learning Targets (SLTs)**.
- **Lessons**, **Assignments**, and **Projects** can be created to support students to develop expertise on SLT.

## The PBL Framework
To build a PBL Course, the first step is to write a list of Student Learning Targets, organized into Modules. Then, each SLT can be mapped flexibly to Lesson, Assignments, and Projects, like this:

## How to Build an Andamio PBL Course
To build a PBL Course in Andamio, you will need to create two things:

1. **A Course Contract**: A PBL Course Contract defines the purpose of a PBL Course. It will not change frequently.
2. **The Content of your Course**: Lessons and Projects can change frequently -- this is how people learn what is outlined in the Course Contract. It will evolve over time: new tools, new ways of teaching, new examples, new case studies, new projects...and feedback from students.

In this Module, you will learn how to build a PBL Course Contract. In [Module 102](/course/modules/102), you will learn how to write Content for a PBL Course.
