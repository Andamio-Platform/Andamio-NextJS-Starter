## Now is a great chance to review the Student Learning Targets you've written so far.
Take your time with this step.

## What makes a great SLT?

Student Learning Targets precisely describe what students should know and be able to do after participating in a PBL Course, Module, or Lesson. A great SLT will be clear and measurable, and also general enough for re-use.

### Here are some good SLTs:
```
I can ride a bicycle.
I can change the tires on a bicycle.
```

### Here is one that is not so good:
```
I can learn the parts of a bicycle.
I can fix a bicycle.
I can visit Grandma.
```
