## Why Markdown?
**Markdown allows you to own your data in a way that databases do not.**

It is possible to build user interfaces, but let's think for a moment about what would happen if we did that.

### Exploration

## What is Markdoc?
Markdoc is Markdown. Any valid Markdown you write will look great in Andamio. We use Markdoc to create space for extensibility.

### Future Development: Markdoc Components
There is a lot we can explore. We are excited about how Markdoc allows for an open ecosystem of tools while keeping content in the hands of its owners. It's a big idea, and we'll revisit this one over time.
