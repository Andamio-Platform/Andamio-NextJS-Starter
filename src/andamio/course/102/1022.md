## What is Andamio?
> Team - from our work with the Business Model Canvas, let's write our value props here.

Andamio combines a modular learning-management system with a set of smart contracts that support organizations to onboard contributors to projects. To start this course, we will focus on the learning-management features of Andamio. Later, you will learn how to initialize the Andamio Platform on-chain.

## Where can I learn about it?
You are in the right place! This course is our official guide to Andamio.

If you want to go deeper, [Plutus PBL 2023](https://plutuspbl.io/) is the original prototype of Andamio. Right now, students are learning about the Cardano development stack. Enrollment is open now, and you can start any time.

## Where can I read the Andamio Whitepaper?
The [Andamio Whitepaper](https://hackmd.io/@andamio-platform/B1_gJMDvn) is currently published on [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/). It is a work in progress, and you are invited to comment on it. We'll show you how in [Lesson 102.2](/course/module/102/1022).
