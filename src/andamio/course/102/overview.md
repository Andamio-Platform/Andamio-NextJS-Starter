# Welcome to Andamio PBL!

"PBL" stands for "Project-Based Learning", and sometimes for "Problem-Based Learning". In this course, we are going to do a little bit of both.

We built this course to show you what Andamio is and how it works. You can read through the course as you would any documentation. If you want to learn about Andamio by using it, this course is a step-by-step guide on how to build a new Andamio instance.
