Now that you know a little bit about Andamio, we'd like to invite you to Contribute / Govern. Here's how...

## A Living Document
The Andamio Whitepaper is a work in progress. We are building Andamio in the open, alongside everyone who uses it, and the whitepaper is no exception.

Andamio is built to help organizations, communities, and networks collaborate to solve real problems. We know that we don't have all the answers, and our goal is to create systems and spaces where everyone can have an influence on what matters to them. We believe that this creates conditions where problem-solving can happen.

That's why the Andamio Whitepaper is open for comments from anyone.

## How to Make a Comment on HackMD
The [Andamio Whitepaper](https://hackmd.io/@andamio-platform/B1_gJMDvn) is currently published on [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/). HackMD is a "[realtime, multi-platform collaborative markdown knowledge base](https://hackmd.io/s/features)". We've found that it's a great tool for collaboration.
