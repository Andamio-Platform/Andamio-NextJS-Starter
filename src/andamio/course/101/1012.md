# Browser Wallet Integration - SLT 101.1

I can use Mesh to connect a CIP-30 compliant wallet to a decentralized application.

In [Lesson 100.4](/course/module/100/1004), you learned how to start a project with [Next.js]() and Mesh.

In this lesson, you will continue to use the project started in Lesson 100.4.

## Start a New Project Any Time
You can always start a brand new project using the steps laid out in Lesson 100.4, or you can can use the starter template. For this lesson, let's use the starter template.

In a new directory, run the following commands:

```bash
npx create-mesh-app mesh-pbl-module-101 -t starter -s next -l ts
cd mesh-pbl-module-101
npm run dev
```

### Create a Component Directory
In the `mesh-pbl-module-101` directory, make a new folder for `components`. Inside, make a new file named `MyWalletComponent.tsx`:
```bash
mkdir components
cd components
touch MyWalletComponent.tsx
```

### Initialize the Component
Open `MyWalletComponent.tsx` and copy the following code:
```typescript
import { useWallet } from "@meshsdk/react";

export default function MyWalletComponent() {
  const wallet = useWallet();

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>This is my wallet component!</h2>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(wallet, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Note on Styling
In this example, we are using some styles provided by Mesh. Look at the `<Head>` in `/pages/index.tsx` to see how `template.css` is imported.
```typescript
<Head>
  <title>Mesh App on Cardano</title>
  <meta name="description" content="A Cardano dApp powered my Mesh" />
  <link
    rel="icon"
    href="https://meshjs.dev/favicon/favicon-32x32.png"
  />
  <link
    href="https://meshjs.dev/css/template.css"
    rel="stylesheet"
    key="mesh-demo"
  />
</Head>
```

You can add your own styles to this project - but that's beyond the scope of this course. (Should we include some links here to futher resources? Should we say a word about frameworks like Tailwind?)



## Great, your wallet is connected!
Now you have seen some different options for getting started:
1. You can start from scratch using the process outlined in Lesson 100.4, or you can use a starter template.
2. You can use the `<CardanoWallet />` component.

## Extension - Build Your Own Component:
If you are an experienced developer and want to go deeper into Mesh, try this.
- Build your own wallet component.
- Note to team -- how can we expose some information without overwhelming people.
- Maybe link to source code? For example: https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/blob/main/packages/demo/components/pages/apis/browserwallet/connectWallet.tsx
