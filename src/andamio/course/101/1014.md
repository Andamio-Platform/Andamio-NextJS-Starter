## Introduction

In [the previous lesson](/course/module/101/1013), you learned how to view information about a wallet in the browser. The `useWallet()` hook was used to view information about the connected wallet, and the `useAssets()` was used to view a list of native assets in the connected wallet.

Mesh provides [a variety of React hooks](https://meshjs.dev/react/wallet-hooks) that handle essential dapp functionality and make it easier to get started building. Let's take a look at each of these hooks.

## Prerequisites
In order to use the Mesh React Wallet Hooks, you must set up a Mesh Provider as shown in [Lesson 101.1](/course/module/101/1011). For this lesson, we will assume that you have a working project running locally.

# Mesh React Wallet Hooks

In the following examples, we will take a look at how use each Mesh React Wallet Hook. There is no styling added to these examples: simply basic demonstrations that can help you get started building any user interface you want. All of the example code is [provided in the Mesh PBL Student Library](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh-pbl-student-library). You can clone this repo to get started quickly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh-pbl-student-library
cd mesh-pbl-student-library
npm install
npm run dev
```

In [the Assignment that follows](/course/module/101/assigment101), we will suggest some ways that you can start to build with these hooks. In the rest of the course, we will go deeper into Mesh functionality, and we will practice using these hooks in different ways.

## `useWallet`
The [`useWallet` hook](https://meshjs.dev/react/wallet-hooks#useWallet) provides information on the current wallet's state, and provides functions for connecting and disconnecting a user wallet.

Here is an example of how to use it:
```typescript
import { CardanoWallet, useWallet } from "@meshsdk/react";

export default function WalletHooksExamples() {
  const wallet = useWallet();

  return (
    <div>
      <CardanoWallet />
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(wallet, null, 2)}</pre>
      <p>{wallet.connected ? "wallet is connected" : "wallet is not connected"}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## `useAssets`
The [`useAssets` hook](https://meshjs.dev/react/wallet-hooks#useAssets) returns a list assets in the connected wallet. This hook is useful when you need a quick way to check for assets in the connected wallet.

Here is an example of how to use it:
```typescript
import { CardanoWallet, useAssets } from "@meshsdk/react";

export default function UseWalletDemoPage() {
  const assets = useAssets();

  return (
    <div>
      <CardanoWallet />
      {assets ? <pre>{JSON.stringify(assets, null, 2)}</pre> : "Connect a wallet to view assets."}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## `useWalletList`
The [`useWalletList` hook](https://meshjs.dev/react/wallet-hooks#useWalletList) returns a list of wallets installed in the user's browser. It is helpful when you want to build a user interface that allows people to choose a wallet to connect to an application. You might be familiar with this functionality already: on many DeFi applications, there is a "Connect Wallet" button that prompts the user to select a wallet. In a well-designed application, the user will only see options for wallets that are actually installed. In this example, we will not build a complete UI - but as an exercise, you can try to create one!

Here is an example of how to use it:
```typescript
import { CardanoWallet, useWalletList } from "@meshsdk/react";
import Image from "next/image";

export default function UseWalletListDemoPage() {
  const walletList = useWalletList();

  return (
    <div>
      <CardanoWallet />
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(walletList, null, 2)}</pre>
      <div>
        {walletList.map((item) => (
          <Image key={item.name} src={item.icon} alt={item.name} width={100} height={100} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## `useAddress`
The [`useAddress` hook](https://meshjs.dev/react/wallet-hooks#useAddress) provides a quick way for your application to get the address of the connected wallet.

Here is an example of how to use it:
```typescript
import { CardanoWallet, useAddress } from "@meshsdk/react";

export default function UseAddressDemoPage() {
  const address = useAddress();

  return (
    <div>
      <CardanoWallet />
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(address, null, 2)}</pre>
      <p>{address ? `Connected with address: ${address}`: "wallet is not connected"}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## `useLovelace`
The [`useLovelace` hook](https://meshjs.dev/react/wallet-hooks#useLovelace) provides a quick way for your application to get the amount of lovelace in the connected wallet. Remember that 1 Ada = 1000000 Lovelace.

Here is an example of how to use it:
```typescript
import { CardanoWallet, useLovelace } from "@meshsdk/react";

export default function UseLovelaceDemoPage() {
  const lovelace = useLovelace();

  return (
    <div>
      <CardanoWallet />
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(lovelace, null, 2)}</pre>
      <p>{lovelace ? `Wallet has ${parseInt(lovelace) / 1000000} ada` : "wallet is not connected"}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## `useNetwork`
The [`useNetwork` hook](https://meshjs.dev/react/wallet-hooks#useNetwork) returns the network of the connected wallet. This hook is useful when you are testing an application and want to make sure that the user is connected to the correct network. `useNetwork` returns `0` for Cardano Preview and Preprod networks, and `1` for Cardano Mainnet.

Here is an example of how to use it:
```typescript
import { CardanoWallet, useNetwork } from "@meshsdk/react";

export default function UseNetworkDemoPage() {
  const network = useNetwork();

  return (
    <div>
      <CardanoWallet />
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(network, null, 2)}</pre>
      {network == 0 && "connected to a Cardano Testnet"}
      {network == 1 && "connected to Cardano Mainnet"}
    </div>
  );
}
```
