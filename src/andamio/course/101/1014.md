In the previous lesson, you created a component that displays the assets in a connected wallet, but it doesn't look very good!

In this lesson, let's style the component a bit.

## Step By Step

### Step 1: Create a New Page

### Step 2: Import MyWalletAssetComponent

### Step 3: Add Styles to MyWalletAssetComponent
In this template, we are using a stylesheet provided by Mesh:
```html
<link href="https://meshjs.dev/css/template.css" rel="stylesheet" key="mesh-demo" />
```

You may need to remove this link in order to add your own custom styles. We'll take a look at how to do this with [Tailwind CSS]() in an upcoming lesson. There are other libraries you can use.

## Notes + Next Steps
- In Module 102 we will investigate each of the Mesh React hooks.
- You can create components using these hooks
- In Assignment 101, you will add a component to the Mesh Student Library...
