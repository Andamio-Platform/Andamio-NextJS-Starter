The best way to learn about Andamio is by using it. In this Module, we'll show you how Learners interact with Andamio.

You will need a Cardano Browser wallet installed. (Tutorial here. Included testnet and collateral.)

It takes about 30 minutes to complete this module. When you're done, you'll be using a cutting edge decentralized application on Cardano's Preproduction Testnet.
