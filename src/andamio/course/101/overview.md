The best way to learn about Andamio is by using it. In this Module, you will see how **Learners** interact with Andamio.

You will need a Cardano Browser wallet (like [Nami](https://namiwallet.io/) or [Eternl](https://eternl.io/app/mainnet/welcome)) installed. You will also need to connect your wallet to the [Cardano Preproduction Testnet](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/developer-portal/blob/staging/docs/get-started/testnets-and-devnets.md), and get some "Test Ada" from the [Cardano Testnets Faucet](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet/).

If you have never taken these steps before, learn more at the following links:
1. [Connect a Wallet to Cardano Preproduction Testnet](https://plutuspbl.io/modules/100/1001)
2. [Get Test Ada from Faucet](https://plutuspbl.io/modules/100/1002)

It takes about 30 minutes to complete this module. When you're done, you'll be using Andamio on Cardano's Preproduction Testnet.
