With Andamio, student learning can be tracked on-chain.

You can mint a token that represents your progress in this course. You can give it any name you'd like. It will be as public as any other NFT, so decide how much privacy you want on-chain. For now, we think that an alias is best.

### Connect to Preprod
This Andamio PBL works on testnet, so that you can learn about Andamio without spending real Ada. Later, we'll show you how to build an Andamio instance on Cardano Mainnet.

Here is how to connect.

### You'll need some Test Ada.
Once your wallet is connected, press this button to get some free tAda!

### Mint a Token!
Link, embed, or build an Assignment Layout that shows a commitment component.
