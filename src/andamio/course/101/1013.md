Now you're getting a feel how Andamio supports people to learn by doing. We hope that you're excited by what you've learned so far. More than anything, we want you to know that you know what you know, and to feel the motivation that comes from that.

And of course, it's nice to have a little something to show as proof of what you know. Now that you have committed to the first Assignment, a **Course Facilitator** will approve it.

The approval process is an important part of how Andamio works. In this course, we'll look at that too.
