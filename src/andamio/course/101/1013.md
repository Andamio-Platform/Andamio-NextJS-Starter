In the [previous lesson](/course/module/101/1012), you built a simple component that shows some basic information about your wallet. In this lesson, we will make this component a bit more useful.

We can get a list of assets in your connected wallet.

## Step By Step

### Step 1: Create a new component

In the `/src/components` directory, make a new file called `MyWalletAssetComponent.tsx`

### Step 2: Copy the Component from Lesson 101.2

In `MyWalletAssetComponent.tsx`, copy the component from the previous lesson and give the function a new name, like this:

```typescript
import { useWallet } from "@meshsdk/react";

export default function MyWalletAssetComponent() {
  const wallet = useWallet();

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>This is my wallet component!</h2>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(wallet, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Step 3: Add the Component to Your Application

In this example, we will continue to build on the main page of the app. Open `/src/pages/index.tsx` and find this part:

```typescript
<div className="demo">
  <MyWalletComponent />
</div>
```

Below these lines, add the following:

```typescript
<div className="demo">
  <MyWalletAssetComponent />
</div>
```

At the top of the file, find this line:

```typescript
import MyWalletComponent from "../components/MyWalletComponent";
```

And add a new import statement below it:

```typescript
import MyWalletAssetComponent from "../components/MyWalletAssetComponent";
```

Use `npm run dev` to start your development server. In a web browser, open `http://localhost:3000`. You should now see two copies of the same component on the page:

### Step 4: Update the Component

You can use different hooks to quickly get different information about the connected wallet. Replace `MyWalletAssetComponent` with the following code:

```typescript
import { useAssets } from "@meshsdk/react";

export default function MyWalletAssetComponent() {
  const assets = useAssets();

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>This is my assets component!</h2>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(assets, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Save the file, and view [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) again. What do you see?

## Notes + Next Steps

- This might be interesting data, but it does not "look" very useful yet. In the [next lesson](/course/module/101/1014) we will refine the UI a bit by adding some styles.
- Remember that [React Components are reusable](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component). This means that you can place a component like `<MyWalletAssetComponent />` on many pages in your application. In [Assignment 101](/course/module/101/assignment101), you will make a new page that re-uses `MyWalletAssetComponent`.
