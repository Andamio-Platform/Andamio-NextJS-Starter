For now, your Assignment is simply to commit to this Assignment. In Assignment 102, you'll have to do a little more than this!

## How to Commit to an Assignment
1. Make sure that you have a Learner Token.
1. Make sure that your wallet is connected.
3. Press the **Commit to Assignment** above!
4. You will be prompted to enter some **Assignment Info**. For now, you can just write a short message. Later in this course, you will learn more about how Assignment evidence works.

## You will know you are successful if:
1. Your Learner Token is no longer in your wallet.
2. You can see the transaction you just sent in your transaction history.
3. You can [see your Assignment Commitment listed here](/course-management/assignment-commitments).
