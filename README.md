# Mesh Project Based Learning

## How to contribute

### For writers:
1. Create a new branch that forks from `main`, with branch name convention `write: 100.1`
2. Create required files and write contents in the created branch
3. Create a Pull Request when done

### For reviewers:
1. Browse the list of open PRs and self-assign to review the content
2. Continue to review the content in the same branch
3. If further review is needed, branch out as `review: 100.1`, create a PR once done
4. If the content is good to go, merge the PR
5. If the content needs to be revised, leave comments and request changes in the PR
